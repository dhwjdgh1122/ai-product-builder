# Blueprint: Lotto Number Generator

## 1. Project Overview

This is a simple, framework-less web application that generates random lottery numbers for users. It provides a clean, modern, and visually appealing interface for generating and viewing lottery number history. The application is built using modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, following Baseline web standards.

## 2. Style, Design, and Features (V1)

### **Visual Design**
*   **Aesthetics:** A unique user experience with modern components, a visually balanced layout with clean spacing, and polished styles.
*   **Color Palette:** A vibrant and energetic look and feel with a wide range of color concentrations and hues. The primary colors are a deep navy blue for the background and a bright gold for accents and interactive elements.
*   **Typography:** Expressive and relevant typography using the "Poppins" font from Google Fonts. Font sizes are stressed to create a clear hierarchy (hero text, headlines, etc.).
*   **Texture & Effects:**
    *   A subtle noise texture is applied to the main background for a premium, tactile feel.
    *   Multi-layered drop shadows create a strong sense of depth, making cards and interactive elements appear "lifted".
    *   Interactive elements have a "glow" effect on hover.
*   **Iconography:** A lottery ball icon is used as the favicon to enhance brand identity.
*   **Layout:** The application is fully responsive and works perfectly on mobile and web, using modern CSS like Flexbox for layout.

### **Features**
*   **Number Generation:** Users can click a button to generate 6 unique random numbers between 1 and 45.
*   **Visual Feedback:** The generated numbers are displayed in styled "lotto balls" with a smooth appearance animation.
*   **History Tracking:** A history of all generated number sets is displayed in a list for users to review.

## 3. Current Task: Initial Design and Server Restart

**Plan:**
1.  **Restart Server:** Execute `npx serve` to make the application available at `http://localhost:3000`.
2.  **Enhance Visual Design:**
    *   Apply a new color palette, including a navy background and gold accents.
    *   Integrate the "Poppins" Google Font for improved typography.
    *   Add a subtle background texture using a noise image.
    *   Add `box-shadow` to create depth for the main container and buttons.
    *   Implement a "glow" effect on button hover.
    *   Create a smooth fade-in animation for the generated numbers.
3.  **Add Favicon:** Add a `favicon.ico` to the project and link it in the `index.html`.
